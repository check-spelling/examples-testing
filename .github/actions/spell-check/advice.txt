If you run into a url form that you can't easily
whitelist, consider adding a pattern into
[.github/actions/spell-check/patterns.txt](../blob/youtube/.github/actions/spell-check/patterns.txt).

If you have a file / directory / set of files
that shouldn't be checked, please add them to
[.github/actions/spell-check/excludes/excludes.txt](../blob/youtube/.github/actions/spell-check/excludes/excludes.txt).

Otherwise, you can add whitelist entries to an
appropriate file in:
[.github/actions/spell-check/whitelist/](../blob/youtube/.github/actions/spell-check/whitelist/).
